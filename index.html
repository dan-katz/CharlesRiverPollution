      The Charles River runs 80 miles from Hopkinton, Massachusetts to the New Charles River Dam, where it flows into Boston Harbor. The stretch of river from Watertown to Boston Harbor, known as the
Lower Basin of the Charles, is a well-known Boston landmark, widely recognized for its recreational
and aesthetic value to the communities that surround it.

      Though the Charles River is a relatively small river, with a watershed encompassing 308 square miles and parts of 35 cities and towns, it is home to approximately one million people, making it one of the most densely populated watersheds in New England. The River itself meanders through 23 communities with diverse character, from the more rural upper watershed in Hopkinton and Milford, to the urban lower watershed communities of Boston and Cambridge.

      In 1995, the EPA launched the Clean Charles Initiative, with the goal to make the river “fishable” and “swimmable”. The data collected by the Charles Wiver Watershed Association at their monitoring sites along the river is used by the EPA to assign the Charles River Lower Basin a report card grade each year.

      E. coli are used as a water quality indicator for the Charles River. Most strains of E. coli are not harmful to humans, but because they are found in the digestive system of most warm-blooded mammals, the presence of E. coli indicates the presence of other bacteria and viruses that are potentially harmful to human health. (Source: New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services)</p>
    </br/>
    <p>The Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards set two action limits for mean E. coli levels. Standards are set by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) to indicate level of health risk in freshwaters.  MassDEP recommends not swimming or fishing when the geometric mean of bacteria counts exceed 126/100ml, and not boating on days when the geometric mean of levels rise above 630/100ml.</p>

    <p>CRWA’s monitoring program involves water quality monitoring at 35 regular sites spanning the entire 80-mile stretch of the Charles River. Thirty-three of the 35 regular sampling sites are distributed along the 80 miles of the main stem Charles River between Milford and Boston. The remaining two regular sites are located on the Stop River in Medfield and the Muddy River in Boston, both tributaries to the Charles. The sites are distributed fairly evenly along the length of the River, with sites slightly more concentrated around the heavily urbanized areas in Boston and the surrounding cities.</p>
